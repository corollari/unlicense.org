## How to
If you'd like to modify the contents of the page, you can edit `README.md` directly, if you'd rather change the presentation, modify `static/pandoc.css`.

After applying your modifications, you can build the website following the instructions in the **Build** section.

## Build
1. [Install pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
2. Run `./build.sh`
